## Description
This app is a challenge from my bootcamp to show our skills with node and inquirer. The app itself is quite useful, a professional readme generator! It allows you to quickly and easily generate a README.md with a series of questions/prompts such as about title,description, installation, license, and contribution.


## Installation
inquirer: 8.2.4
node.js: 0.0.1-security

## Usage
Usage would include any project that needs a README. This app allows you to quickly create a professional README with ease.
